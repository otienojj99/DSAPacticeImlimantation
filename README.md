This project is a simple C program that demonstrates how to create and traverse a singly linked list using dynamic memory allocation (malloc).

===Features===
Allows the user to enter multiple integers.

Dynamically creates nodes for each input using malloc.

Connects the nodes to form a singly linked list.

Traverses the linked list and prints each value.

===How It Works===
The program keeps asking the user for numbers until they choose to stop.

Each number is stored in a newly created node.

Nodes are linked together using pointers.

After the user finishes input, the program prints all values in the linked list.

==== Example Input & Output===
Enter Data: 4
press 1 to continue, 0 to end: 1
Enter Data: 8
press 1 to continue, 0 to end: 1
Enter Data: 9
press 1 to continue, 0 to end: 1
Enter Data: 0
press 1 to continue, 0 to end: 0
4
8
9
0
Total nodes: 4
